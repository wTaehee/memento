    <h1>On <em>Handmade Web</em></h1>
    <p>9/6/22</p>
    <p><em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</em></p>
    <p>This reminds me of my research on early websites and webzines during the early 2000s in South Korea. "Zine" or "zine culture" are fairly new in South Korean art scene but there always has been printed matters that has been circulating to spread the knowledge to break the institutal barrier or state oppression. My personal opinion is that the feminist and queer websites/webzines are closest to the DIY nature of punk era of zine. Except we never called them as "zine." I think it is interesting when websites have their tactility despite their virtual nature much like how unapologic the xerox copy zines are. They are tangible. But not in a quantifying way but bodily and human way.</p>
